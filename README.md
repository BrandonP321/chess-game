# 1-2-3 Chess
1-2-3 Chess is simple chess game that makes it easier than pie to hop straight into a game with some friends

# Motivation
Being a fan of chess myself, I set out to re-create on of the world's most iconic board games.  This wasn't only a chance for me to prove my knowledge of object oriented programming with concepts such as inheritance, but it was also a chance implement a feature that no other chess game offers.  1-2-3 Chess allows other people to spectate your game (which isn't anything unique), but what is unique is that you as a player can trade places with a spectator, meaning you would become a spectator and they would become the player.
